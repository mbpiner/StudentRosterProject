Scripting and Programming Applications Project

-----

This is a class project for the Scripting and Programming - Applications in WGU's CS program.

The goal of this project is to create a class roster using C++.

There is a base Student class with the following variables:

student ID, first name, last name, email, age, array of number of days to complete each course, and degree types.

There are multiple functions:
An accessor (i.e., getter) for each instance variable, a mutator (i.e., setter) for each instance variable, constructor using all of the input parameters provided in the table, virtual print() to print specific student data, a destructor, and a virtual getDegreeProgram()

There are three subclasses which inherit from Student: Security, Network, and Software.

The roster program loops through the students, prints select information as requested, and and allows removal of specified Student records.
